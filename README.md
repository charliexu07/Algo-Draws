AlgoArt is an Online TSP Studio that uses the famous Traveling Salesman Problem optimization to generate a continuous line drawing from a given image. It first samples points from the image in a way that darker regions have more packed points. Then it solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using those points as cities. The resulting tour is a continuous closed path that, when drawn, resembles the initial picture. Notice that we visualized the algorithm while making the TSP art.
